1. Introduction
2. ER - Entity Relationship Model

    Terms:
    ------
      1. Entity -> Customer

      2. Attributes -> Details of customer like name, age, etc..

        Types of Attributes
        --------------------
          1. Simple - atomic value which cannot be divided
          
          2. Composite - a value that can be divided into sub parts
          
          3. Derived - a value that is not stored in the db, but Derived from other Attributes
              e.g. age is Derived from DOB and current date
              e.g. if pincode is stored, then we can derive city & state information
          
          4. Multivalued - an Attribute which can have more than one value
              e.g. mobile number -> a person can have more than one

      3. Relationships -> linking multiple entities together

      4. Cardinality
          Defines the numerical Attributes of the relationship between entities or entity sets

          Types of Cardinality:
          ---------------------
          1. One to One
          2. One to many
          3. Many to One
          4. Many to Many
 
    ER Diagram
    -----------
      1. Rectangles - entity
      2. Ellipses - represents Attributes
      3. Diamonds - represents relationship Types
      4. Lines - links atttributes to entity type and entity types with other relationship types
      5. Primary Key - attributes that are underlined
      5. Doube Ellipses - represents Multivalued attributes

    Relationship Cardinality
    ------------------------
      Mandatory one
      Mandatory many
      Optional one
      Optional many

    Steps for DB Design:
    --------------------
      -> Entity Identification 
      -> Relationship Identification 
      -> Cardinality Identification 
      -> Identidy attributes 
      -> Create ERD

3. Functional Dependencies
4. Normalization
5. Indexing
